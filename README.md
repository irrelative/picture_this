# Picture This

This is a port of the game Drawful, as best as possible, using the following technology:

* Golang backend (Go 1.25.5)
* Golang templ templating for WebUI and mobile interfaces
* Websockets used for server and client syncing
* Minimal javascipt, no frameworks
* WebUI frontend for managing the game, showing "secret" code
* Postgres for backend state storage of game, drawings, etc. The game should be able to crash and be restarted without losing game state.

## Planned Server Endpoints (Draft)
- `POST /api/games` — create a new game; returns `game_id` and `join_code`.
- `POST /api/games/{game_id}/join` — join a game with a player name.
- `GET /api/games/{game_id}` — fetch a state snapshot for reconnects.
- `POST /api/games/{game_id}/start` — host starts the game.
- `POST /api/games/{game_id}/prompts` — submit prompts for the round.
- `POST /api/games/{game_id}/drawings` — submit a drawing for a prompt.
- `POST /api/games/{game_id}/guesses` — submit a guess for a drawing.
- `POST /api/games/{game_id}/votes` — submit vote(s) for the round.
- `POST /api/games/{game_id}/advance` — host/admin advances phase if needed.
- `GET /api/games/{game_id}/results` — fetch round or final results.
- `GET /ws/games/{game_id}` — websocket for realtime state/events.

For now, don't include:
* Sound effects/music
* Voiceover. Instead, have the instructions printed to the WebUI
