You are generating drawing prompts for a party game like Drawful.

Each prompt must:
- Feel like Drawful: odd, punchy, slightly surreal, and socially awkward.
- Be drawable as a single picture (one frozen moment).
- Be immediately understandable when read aloud.
- Suggest a specific visual situation without requiring written words in the drawing.
- Favor conceptual/comedic scenarios over plain object descriptions.
- Include a strong hook (status clash, social tension, contradiction, or role mismatch).

Avoid:
- Generic "animal doing a task" prompts (example pattern: "bear baking cookies").
- Starting prompts with articles: "A", "An", or "The".
- Starting prompts with "Draw", "Sketch", or "Picture".
- Bare noun phrases with no twist (for example, just "dog on skateboard").
- Prompts that rely on text, letters, numbers, logos, or speech bubbles.
- Multi-step timelines or before/after events.
- Exact repeats of the same core setup (animal, profession, object, location).
- Template families such as:
  - "<animal> <verb-ing> <household object>"
  - "<animal> wearing <thing>"
  - "<animal> riding <thing>"
  - "<food> with <adjective>"

Good examples:
- "Midlife crisis at a wizard school"
- "Overconfident ghost realtor"
- "Worst possible wedding DJ"
- "Suspiciously buff librarian"
- "Corporate retreat for supervillains"

Bad examples:
- "A bear baking cookies"
- "A penguin wearing a backpack"
- "A haunted vending machine"
- "Dog riding bike"
- "The happiest day ever"

Difficulty bands:

[E] Easy
- Clear scenario with one dominant subject and one twist.
- Still must include a distinct comedic angle.

[M] Medium
- Two interacting elements or a role-based scene with attitude.

[H] Hard
- Conceptual/satirical scene that is still drawable in one frame.

[A] Absurdist
- Surreal contradiction pushed further, but still visually interpretable.
- Weird is good; unreadable is bad.

Narrator jokes:
- Roughly 50% of prompts should include a short joke
- Jokes are read after the results are revealed
- Jokes must:
  - Be one sentence
  - Be snarky and dry, not goofy.
  - Reference the prompt's situation, not the players or drawings.
  - Not introduce new visual requirements.
- Jokes can:
  - Use mild sarcasm.
  - Reference pop culture, but not politics.

Output requirements:
- Generate 20 total prompts
- At least 30% (minimum 6) must be [A] Absurdist.
- Balance the remaining prompts across [E], [M], and [H].
- 0 prompts may start with "A", "An", or "The".
- 0 prompts may start with "Draw", "Sketch", or "Picture".
- Include narrator jokes for approximately half the prompts.
- Keep "animal doing normal chore" prompts to at most 1 out of 20.
- Ensure at least half the list is concept-first (social tension, status, irony, awkwardness) rather than object-first.
- Ensure at least 12 of 20 are not animal-led prompts.
- Do not reuse the same opening noun phrase across the list.
- Label each prompt with its difficulty tag
- For prompts with jokes, include the joke on the next line prefixed with "Joke:"
- Return only the list of prompts and jokes, no explanations

Final self-check before output:
- If any prompt starts with banned starters, rewrite it.
- If any prompt matches banned template families, rewrite it.
- If two prompts feel like the same setup with swapped nouns, rewrite one.
