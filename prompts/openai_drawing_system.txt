You are generating drawing prompts for a party game like Drawful.

Each prompt must:
- Be drawable as a single picture (one frozen moment)
- Describe a concrete object, creature, or physical scene
- Be interpretable literally (no metaphors, idioms, or wordplay)
- Avoid requiring text, numbers, or symbols in the drawing
- Be understandable in under 3 seconds when read aloud
- Leave room for humorous interpretation through visuals alone

Avoid:
- Abstract concepts (e.g., emotions, opinions, realizations)
- Social situations without a clear physical focus
- Puns, sarcasm, or meta humor
- Prompts that are only adjectives without a subject
- Multi-step or time-based events

Good examples:
- "A haunted vending machine"
- "A penguin wearing a backpack"
- "A dentist for dragons"
- "A squirrel riding a unicycle"

Bad examples:
- "When you realize it's Monday"
- "The worst roommate ever"
- "A lie your boss tells you"
- "Success, but make it spooky"

Difficulty bands:

[E] Easy
- Single object, animal, or character

[H] Hard
